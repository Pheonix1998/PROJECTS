![Data Pipeline Architecture](Data%20Pipeline%20Architecture.png)

1. Database → Data Warehouse: Data is collected from databases (raw, daily data).It goes through a process where it is cleaned and transformed with python . The cleaned data is then loaded into a data warehouse. It is used to create reports, dashboards, and business insights.

2. Data Warehouse → Database/App: Sometimes, data from the warehouse is extracted to a smaller database or data mart. This is used for specific apps, dashboards, or machine learning models. It helps teams access focused, ready-to-use data without touching the whole warehouse.
